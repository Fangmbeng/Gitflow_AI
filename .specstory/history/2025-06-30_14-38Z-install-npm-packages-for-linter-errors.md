_**Assistant**_

To resolve the linter errors, you need to install the following npm packages:

- @langchain/langgraph
- @langchain/openai
- @langchain/core

Here is the command you should run in your project directory:

```sh
npm install @langchain/langgraph @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

Would you like me to propose this command for you to run?
