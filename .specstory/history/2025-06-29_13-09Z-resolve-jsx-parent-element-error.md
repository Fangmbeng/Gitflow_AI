_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
JSX expressions must have one parent element.
```

The error `JSX expressions must have one parent element.` means your component's return statement (or a JSX block) is returning multiple sibling elements at the top level, which is not allowed in React. You must wrap all returned JSX in a single parent element, such as a `<div>` or a React fragment (`<>...</>`).

**How to fix:**
- Find the return statement of your component.
- Ensure all JSX is wrapped in a single parent element.

**In your file:**  
The return statement in `MultiAgentArchitectureSystem` is very long, but the linter error points to this:

```tsx
return (
  <div className="h-screen ...">
    {/* ...all your JSX... */}
  </div>
);
```

But, further down, there is a duplicated block of JSX (starting at line 957) that is not inside the main return's parent `<div>`. This is likely a copy-paste or merge artifact.

**Concise fix:**  
- Remove the duplicated JSX block after the main return's closing `</div>`.
- Make sure there is only one return statement and one top-level parent element.

**Summary:**  
- Only one return statement per component.
- All JSX in the return must be inside a single parent element.

Would you like me to clean up the file and remove the duplicate/erroneous JSX for you?

This error usually means there is a mismatch in your parentheses or JSX tagsâ€”often caused by an extra or missing closing tag, or by returning multiple root elements without a wrapper.

**In your code:**  
You have:
```tsx
return (
  <div>
    <div className="h-screen ...">
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
    {/* ... */}
  </div>
);
```
But, based on the linter and your code, you likely have:
- An extra `<div>` wrapping the main content, or
- Unclosed or duplicated JSX blocks at the end of your file.

**Concise fix:**
- Make sure your return statement has only one parent element.
- Remove any duplicate or stray `<div>` or JSX blocks after your main return's closing tag.
- Ensure all opening tags have matching closing tags.

**Example fix:**
If you have:
```tsx
return (
  <div>
    <div className="h-screen ...">
      {/* ...all your JSX... */}
    </div>
  </div>
);
```
You can simplify to:
```tsx
return (
  <div className="h-screen ...">
    {/* ...all your JSX... */}
  </div>
);
```

**Summary:**  
- Only one parent element in your return.
- No duplicate or stray JSX after the main return.
- All tags properly closed.

This error is caused by a stray string or malformed JSX. In your code, you have this line:

```tsx
        )}="inline-flex items-center space-x-3 px-4 py-2 bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-sm 
                           rounded-xl shadow-[0_8px_32px_rgba(0,0,0,0.1)] border border-white/50"
              >
                <Brain className="w-5 h-5 text-indigo-600" />
                <span className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-700">Master Agent - Architecture Orchestration</span>
              </motion.div>
            </div>
            <AnimatePresence>
              {messages.map((message) => (
```

This is a copy-paste or merge artifact. The `="inline-flex ...` is not valid JSX and is causing the error.

**Concise fix:**
- Delete everything from `)}="inline-flex ...` up to the next valid JSX block.
- Make sure your conditional rendering ends with a proper closing parenthesis and bracket, like this:
  ```tsx
  </div>
  )}
  {/* ...next JSX... */}
  ```

**Summary:**  
Remove the stray `)}="inline-flex ...` and the following lines up to the next valid JSX. This will resolve the "Expression expected" error.

_**Assistant**_

This error is caused by the following invalid code fragment:

```tsx
        )}="inline-flex items-center space-x-3 px-4 py-2 bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-sm 
                           rounded-xl shadow-[0_8px_32px_rgba(0,0,0,0.1)] border border-white/50"
              >
```

This is a copy-paste or merge artifact and is not valid JSX or JavaScript.

**Concise fix:**  
- Delete the entire line starting with `)}="inline-flex ...` and the lines immediately following it until you reach the next valid JSX or code block.

**Summary:**  
Remove the stray `)}="inline-flex ...` and its following lines. This will resolve the `',' expected.` and related syntax errors.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'string' can't be used to index type '{ minimal: string; low: string; medium: string; high: string; enterprise: string; }'.
  No index signature with a parameter of type 'string' was found on type '{ minimal: string; low: string; medium: string; high: string; enterprise: string; }'.
```

This TypeScript error occurs because the object (e.g., `budgets`) is defined with specific string keys, but you are using a dynamic string (`session.requirements.budget`) to index it. TypeScript cannot guarantee that the string is a valid key.

**Concise fix:**  
Add an index signature to the type, or use a type assertion to tell TypeScript the key is valid.

**Best practice for your case:**  
Use a type assertion when accessing the object:

```tsx
{budgets[session.requirements.budget as keyof typeof budgets]}
```

Do the same for `businessTypes` and `sectors`:

```tsx
{businessTypes[session.requirements.businessType as keyof typeof businessTypes]}
{sectors[session.requirements.sector as keyof typeof sectors]}
```

**Summary:**  
Add `as keyof typeof budgets` (or the relevant object) when indexing with a dynamic string.

```
JSX fragment has no corresponding closing tag.
```

This error means you have an opening `<>` (React fragment) without a matching closing `</>`. In your code, you have:

```tsx
{currentView === 'chat' ? (
  // CHAT VIEW
  <>
    {/* Main Chat Area */}
    ...
```

But you must also close this fragment before the `: ( ... )` for the "history" view, like this:

```tsx
{currentView === 'chat' ? (
  <>
    {/* ...chat view... */}
  </>
) : (
  {/* ...history view... */}
)}
```

**Concise fix:**  
- Make sure every `<>` has a matching `</>`.
- Add `</>` just before the `: ( ... )` for the history view.

**Summary:**  
Close your fragment with `</>` before the `: ( ... )` in your ternary conditional rendering.
