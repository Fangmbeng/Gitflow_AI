```diff
- @tailwind base;
- @tailwind components;
+ @import "tailwindcss/preflight";
  @tailwind utilities;
  
```

I have updated your `src/app/globals.css` file to be compatible with Tailwind CSS v4, as indicated by the linter errors:

- Replaced `@tailwind base;` with `@import "tailwindcss/preflight";`
- Removed `@tailwind components;`
- Kept `@tailwind utilities;`

Your file should now work correctly with Tailwind v4. If you need further adjustments or run into any other issues, let me know!
