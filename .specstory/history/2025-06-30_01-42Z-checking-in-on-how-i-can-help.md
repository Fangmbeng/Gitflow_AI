It appears that the file `src/lib/components/MultiAgentArchitectureSystem.tsx` is not tracked by git, so a `git restore` cannot revert it. This usually means the file was either newly created or has never been committed to git.

If you want to revert the changes, you have a few options:
- If you want to discard all changes and restore the file to a previous state, you need to have a backup or a committed version.
- If you want to manually remove the changes, I can help you fix the linter errors or revert the file to a blank or initial state.

Please specify:
- Do you want to delete the file, reset it to empty, or fix the current errors?
- Or do you have a backup/committed version you want to restore from? 

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
