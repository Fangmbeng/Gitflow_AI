### Agent Architecture

The system uses a multi-agent architecture where each agent has specialized responsibilities:

- **Master Agent**: Decision making and orchestration
- **Financial Agent**: Cost analysis and ROI calculations  
- **Architecture Agent**: System design generation
- **Documentation Agent**: Technical writing and risk analysis
